  <title>The Normal Distribution</title>

  <p> Imagine you are throwing darts onto the <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m>-plane,
  aiming for the origin <m>(0,0)</m>. After hundereds of darts, what does
  the plane look like?</p>
  <p>
    Assuming you're not a perfect shot, we would expect some variation -
    a dense cluster at the centre that becomes gradually more sparse
    the further away from the origin we look. We also expect is this distribution to be <term>radially symmetric.</term>
  </p>
  <p>
    Let <m>dA\subset\mathbb{R}^2</m> be a small area in the plane. We can
    model the probability on a dart landing in <m>dA</m> as
  </p>
  <mdn xml:id="eqn-norm-1">
    <mrow>\mathbb{P}(\text{dart lands in }dA) =\amp \phi(r)\lambda_2 (dA)</mrow>
  </mdn>
  <p>
    where <m>\lambda_2(dA)</m> is the area of <m>dA</m>, 
    <m>r = \sqrt{x^2+y^2}</m> and <m>\phi</m> is some <term>monotone decreasing</term>
    funtion 
    <m>\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}_{>0}</m>. Note that <m>\theta</m>
    doesn't appear in our model due to radial symmetry.
    
  </p>
  <aside>
    <title>Is it measurable?</title>
    <p>
      <m>\lambda_2</m>
      is known as the 2D Lebesgue measure. <em>Precisely</em> defining this function
      has to be done with extreme care in order to 
      avoid paradoxes caused by <em>certain difficult</em> 
      (non-measurable) subsets of <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m>.
      More detail can be found <url href="https://people.bath.ac.uk/masmdp/measdir.bho/notesp1to10.pdf">here</url>.
    </p>
    
  </aside>
  <p>
    For a single dart, the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> coordingates are
    independent, allowing us to introduce 
  </p>
  <me>\mathbb{P}(\text{dart lands in }dA) = \phi(r)\lambda_2 (dA) = 
    f(x)f(y)\lambda_2 (dA) 
  </me>
  <p>
    where <m>f:\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}_{>0}</m> is another monotone decreasing function, with the relation
  </p>
  <md>
    <mrow>\phi(\sqrt{x^2+y^2}) =\amp f(x)f(y).</mrow>
  </md>
  <p>
    Setting <m>y=0, we have</m>
  </p><md>
    <mrow>\phi(x) =\amp f(x)f(0) = \psi f(x)</mrow>
  </md>
  <p>
    where <m>\psi = f(0) > 0</m> is some constant. Thus,
  </p>
  <md>
    <mrow>\phi(\sqrt{x^2+y^2}) =\amp \psi f(x)
      =f(x)f(y)
    </mrow>
  </md>
  <p>
    dividing through by <m>\psi^2</m>, we have
  </p><md>
    <mrow>\frac{1}{\psi}f(\sqrt{x^2+y^2})
      =\amp \frac{1}{\psi}f(x)\frac{1}{\psi}f(y).</mrow>
  </md>

  <p>
    Define <m>g:\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}_{>0}</m> such that <m>g(x) = \frac{1}{\psi}f(x)</m>. 
    We have that <m>g</m> satisfies
    <me>g(\sqrt{x^2+y^2}) = g(x)g(y).</me>
    Do we know what type of function <m>g</m> is likely to be? Can you think of an example?
