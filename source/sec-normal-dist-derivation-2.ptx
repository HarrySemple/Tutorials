          <em>Distribution is radially symmetric.</em>

          <em>Probability of landing in a region monotonically decreases as the distance away from the origin increases.</em>

    <p>
      From <xref ref="ex-norm-1"/>, we have that
      <me>g(x) = e^{Ax^2}</me>
      where A is some constant. To ensure <m>g</m> is a monotone decreasing function, we set
      <me>g(x) = e^{-h^2x^2}.</me>

    </p>
    <p>
      We now have a candidate <term>probability density function (pdf)</term>
      <me>f(x) = \psi e^{-h^2x^2}.</me>
      All that remains of our derivation is specifying the variables <m>\psi</m> and <m>h</m>. This is done by setting
      <men>\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x) dx = 1</men>
