Assuming you're not a perfect shot, we would expect some variation - a dense cluster at the centre that thins out further away from the origin. We also expect is the scattering to be radially symmetric.   Let be a small region in the plane. We can model the probability on a dart landing in as   where is the area of and is some monotone decreasing funtion , with the distance away from the origin of a token point . Note that doesn't appear in our model due to radial symmetry.   Is it measurable?   is known as the 2D Lebesgue measure. Precisely defining this function has to be done with extreme care in order to avoid paradoxes caused by certain difficult (non-measurable) subsets of . More detail can be found here .   For a single dart, the and coordinates are independent, allowing us to introduce   where is another monotone decreasing function, with the relation   Setting , we have  where is some constant. Thus,   dividing through by , we have  Define such that . We have that satisfies Do we know what type of function is likely to be? Can you think of an example?

Probability of landing in a region monotonically decreases as the distance away from the origin increases.      From , we have that where A is some constant. To ensure is monotone decreasing, set   We now have a candidate probability density function (PDF) for the coordinate That is, the probability of the coordinate of the dart lying in an interval is given by All that remains of our derivation is specifying the variables and . This is done by setting substituting , the problem becomes This is where we come across the Gaussian Integral , an intergral imposibble to compute using standard techniques. Luckily for us, multivariable calculus provides all the tools we require.   The Gaussian Integral  Set . Then Since the integral is constant, we have Since is constant with respect to , we have Simplifying the integrand leaves us with Now we want to make a change of variables into polar coordinates. To do this, we must apply a scaling to the integrand (much as we would do for one-dimensional integration). For integration in higher dimensions, this manifests as the Jacobian . substituting in , we have By choosing appropriate bounds, we now complete the change of variables This leaves us with the satisfying result    "
