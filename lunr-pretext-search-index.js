Assuming you're not a perfect shot, we would expect some variation - a dense cluster at the centre that thins out as we look further away from the origin. We also expect is this scattering to be radially symmetric.   Let be a small region in the plane. We can model the probability on a dart landing in as   where is the area of and is some monotone decreasing funtion , with the distance away from the origin of a token point . Note that doesn't appear in our model due to radial symmetry.   Is it measurable?   is known as the 2D Lebesgue measure. Precisely defining this function has to be done with extreme care in order to avoid paradoxes caused by certain difficult (non-measurable) subsets of . More detail can be found here .   For a single dart, the and coordinates are independent, allowing us to introduce   where is another monotone decreasing function, with the relation   Setting , we have  where is some constant. Thus,   dividing through by , we have  Define such that . We have that satisfies Do we know what type of function is likely to be? Can you think of an example?
